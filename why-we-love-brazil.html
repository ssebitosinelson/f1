                                Nineteen down, two to go and both championships have been won. But there is still plenty
                                to
                                play
                                for at this weekend's Brazilian Grand Prix. Here's why we love going racing at
                                Interlagos…
                            </strong></p>

                        <h2>1. An Iconic venue</h2>
                        <p>Interlagos is steeped with history (more on that later) but it is also a venue that has
                            become
                            synonymous with Formula 1.</p>
                        <p>The sight of the whole field barrelling through the Senna S at the start of the lap is one
                            that
                            just fits, while the wide, flat kerbs and short lap all just add to the Autodromo Jose
                            Carlos
                            Pace’s uniqueness.</p>
                        <p>It might be one of the highest venues on the calendar - behind only Mexico City - but it’s
                            also
                            one of the shortest at 4.309km, as only Mexico and Monaco cover less distance. And yet
                            within
                            that is 43 metres of elevation change between the highest point on the approach to Turn 1
                            and
                            the lowest point at Turn 5.</p>
                        <p>The undulating pit straight that is flanked by a high pit wall and big grandstands leads to a
                            cauldron-like atmosphere on the grid, that also make the pre-race happenings and the
                            post-race
                            podium even more special.</p>
                    </div>

                    <img src="brazilGrid.jpg" alt="">

                    <div class="offset-xl-1">
                        <h2>2. A country with rich F1 history</h2>
                        <p>Ayrton Senna, Nelson Piquet, Emerson Fittipaldi, Felipe Massa, Rubens Barrichello, Carlos
                            Pace…
                            Brazil has had a habit of delivering exciting racing drivers.</p>
                        <p>The circuit might be named after Pace, but Senna is still worshipped like a God in the
                            country,
                            and Sao Paulo is no exception. The Ayrton Senna Institute is based in the city, while his
                            grave
                            is located in Morumbi Cemetery just a few miles from the circuit.</p>
                        <p>But Interlagos was also the scene of some of his most breathtaking victories, including in
                            1991
                            when he finally won his home Grand Prix for the first time and could barely lift his arms
                            above
                            his head such was his pain after battling gearbox issues during the race.</p>
                        <p>Piquet and Fittipaldi join Senna as Brazilian world champions, but drivers such as
                            Barrichello
                            and Massa have come so close to adding to that tally and have provided the Brazilian fans
                            with
                            magical moments in the past. Only the United Kingdom and Germany can boast more world
                            championships than Brazil, with the total of three individual world champions level with
                            Germany
                            and second only to the UK.</p>

                        <h2>3. The fans</h2>
                        <p>We have highlighted the fans at a number of races recently, but each of those venues have had
                            their own unique atmosphere and Interlagos is no different.</p>
                        <p>As referenced in the first section, the atmosphere on the grid is spine-tingling as the fans
                            stand steeply above all those working on the track ahead of the race. When a Brazilian
                            driver is
                            pushed towards the front of the grid, it somehow goes up another level…</p>
                        <p>The whole first sector is flanked by fanatical supporters, all spending the majority of the
                            race
                            on their feet from the run out of Juncao to the finish line and down to Turn 4.</p>
                        <p>So many drivers enjoy loud encouragement at Interlagos and will do so this weekend by an
                            almost
                            football-like crowd, but those flying the Brazilian flag receive something else.</p>

                        <h2>4. Memories of dramatic championship deciders</h2>
                        <p>Interlagos used to be the final race of the season, and with that came some of the most
                            dramatic
                            title deciders in history.</p>
                        <p>More recently, the championship has either been sealed already or gone down to the last round
                            in
                            Abu Dhabi, but if we rewind to 2012 Interlagos saw the culmination of an epic battle between
                            Sebastian Vettel and Fernando Alonso. Championship leader Vettel was hit and spun on the
                            opening
                            lap, opening the door for Alonso, but the German fought through in a damaged car to score
                            the
                            points needed to take a third consecutive crown.</p>
                        <p>It was more heartache for Alonso who had similarly missed out in an absolute epic in 2007,
                            when
                            Lewis Hamilton looked set for the title before a gearbox glitch dropped him down the order
                            early
                            in the race, and a fightback proved in vain as Massa moved over for Ferrari team mate Kimi
                            Raikkonen to snatch the title from the two McLaren drivers by a single point.</p>
                        <p>Yet, somehow, an even more sensational finish to a season was to come a year later, when
                            underdog
                            Massa won in dominant fashion but the weather intervened to spice up the race. Hamilton,
                            needing
                            only fifth place to win the title in his second season, had dropped to sixth behind Vettel
                            in
                            the rain but passed a labouring Timo Glock - who was on slick tyres - at the final proper
                            corner
                            of the race to re-gain fifth and the points needed for a stunning title win.</p>
                        <p>The sight of a tearful Massa pumping his chest in front of the emotional home support remains
                            one
                            of Interlagos and F1’s most iconic podium images.</p>

                        <h2>5. Unpredictable weather</h2>
                        <p>A big part of those championship deciders has been the weather, especially in both 2008 and
                            2012.
                            The first one of those was almost scripted with rain hitting the circuit late and causing
                            all
                            sorts of chaos.</p>
                        <p>And it is not uncommon for rain to hit at some stage during a race weekend. Even if it is on
                            Saturday it can have a major effect on events - anyone remember Nico Hulkenberg taking pole
                            position as a rookie for Williams back in 2010?</p>
                        <p>It’s not even worth checking the weather forecast at this stage because a bit like
                            Spa-Francorchamps it can just change out of seemingly nowhere, and deliver some thrilling
                            races
                            like in 2016 when Max Verstappen further announced himself with an incredible performance
                            (pictured below) to finish second behind the equally outstanding Lewis Hamilton.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>Interlagos + rain = a chance for the greats to shine.</p>
